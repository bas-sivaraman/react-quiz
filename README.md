# React Quiz

An online quiz application built with pure javascript.

## Overview

Its a beginner level project developed as part of a learning experience. While working on it I learnt a lot about DOM manipulation, functions, array methods, inbuilt functions and more. It has a set of 15 questions on React with varying points for each questions. Do try out and perhaps even challenge your friends and have fun!

## Features

As its a simple application, it doesnt have a lot of features. However, I would like to share the things I have learnt and incorporated in this project. I came to know about a new element called 'progress' for  the first time and have implemented the same here. It also has been a refresher for me practising conditionals, array methods, DOM selections and manipulations etc. I have also implemented a timer and when the time is up the quiz ends with the total points displayed along with a restart option.
